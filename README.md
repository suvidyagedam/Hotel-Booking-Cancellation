# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation

Introduction

Hotel Reservation Cancellations Data Analysis and Prediction is a project that aims toidentify the factors that contribute to reservation cancellations for a City Hotel and aResort Hotel. This project involves analyzing a dataset of booking information, testinghypotheses related to the pricing and the day of the week, and developing predictivemodels to make predictions about future cancellations. The primary objective of thisproject is to provide insights into the factors that lead to reservation cancellations andto develop strategies that can help both hotels reduce the number of cancellations. Byanalyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and trends in the data, this project can helpboth hotels to improve their revenue generation and operational efﬁciency. To achievethese goals, the project will involve a thorough analysis of the dataset, including theuse of statistical techniques and data visualization tools. Additionally, the project willinvolve the development of predictive models, which can help both hotels to anticipatecancellations and take proactive measures to prevent them.Overall, this project represents a comprehensive analysis of hotel reservation can-cellations and aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations to help both CityHotel and Resort Hotel reduce cancellations, improve their revenue generation, and op-erate more efﬁciently.

Motivation

There are several compelling reasons why the Hotel Reservation Cancellations DataAnalysis and Prediction project is important and worth pursuing:
    • The project aims to help City Hotel and Resort Hotel to reduce cancellations,improve their revenue generation, and operate more efﬁciently.
    • By identifying the factors that contribute to cancellations, this project can pro-vide valuable insights that can inform pricing, promotions, and other businessdecisions.
